# 🧠 Hey-Omni: Local AI Assistant

Hey-Omni is a privacy-focused AI assistant that runs **entirely on your local machine**. It provides hands-free interaction using wake-word detection, intent handling, and integrates with Google Calendar for event management. This assistant can:

✅ **Local NLP and intent processing** 🏠🔒\
✅ **Provide weather updates** 🌦️\
✅ **Create & manage Google Calendar events** 📅\
✅ **Set and manage timers** ⏳\
✅ **Respond to wake-word commands** 🎙️

🖥️ **Runs as a simple terminal-based model**
